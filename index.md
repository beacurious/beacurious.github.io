## About me

I’m a biologist from Sydney, Australia. I studied at Macquarie University for a Masters of Research in plant biology. Now I’m working on a PhD where I'm using genomics to study biocontrol activities of a beneficial bacteria that colonises plant roots and can protect crops against disease.

When I'm not engrossed in scientific work I enjoy lots of crafty hobbies and I teach mixed media art. In my previous life I was an accountant and I enjoy breaking down accounting concepts for small business owners and assisting them to set up bookkeeping and other systems for their businesses.


## Communication and Teaching

A big part of science for me is communicating ideas – whether that’s to students in a practical class, colleagues, in a journal article, at a conference or with friends over a pizza. Lots of people don’t know what scientists actually do or the diversity of organisms that surround us every day, so I showcase these aspects to students and the public. 

I love that 'ah ha!' moment that comes from teaching. I’m a tutor in Biological Sciences and Molecular Sciences and I’m passionate about sharing the incredible complexity of the natural world. My favourite moment of the semester comes when students who previously had no interest in plants say 'wow, plants are really interesting!'.
